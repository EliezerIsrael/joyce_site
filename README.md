# joyce_site
A Sefaria site configuration for Joyce!

* Start with an emtpy DB
* Run the scripts in the script directory
* Put the site directory someplace where python can find it - e.g. `Sefaria-Project/sites/joyce`
* Put that package name in your Sefaria settings file - e.g. `SITE_PACKAGE = "sites.joyce"`
